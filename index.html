    Pierre Richard in Cannes, 2015
</div>
   <p class="text"> Pierre Richard was born in a Bourgeois family from Valenciennes. He is the grandson of Léopold Defays who was the director of the company Escaut-et-Meuse.
    His name comes from the stage name
    of Pierre Richard-Willm who was his mother's favorite actor.[2] Pierre Richard spent his childhood and a part of his teenage years in his native city where
    he was a student at the Henri-Wallon high school.  Skipping classes regularly to go to the cinema, it was Danny Kaye in Up in Arms that revealed his vocation.

   </p>
    <p class="text">This being received with only a moderate enthusiasm by his family, he had to learn a real profession. He then studied kinesiotherapy without renouncing acting.
    where he played his first sketches written with Victor Lanoux. He then began his film career in 1968 in the film Very Happy Alexander
    directed by Yves Robert. In 1970, he directed his first film Le Distrait, followed by Les Malheurs d'Alfred (1972) and I Don't Know Much,
    But I'll Say Everything (1973).
    </p>
    <p class="text">He worked again with Yves Robert for the film The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1973) and its sequel
        The Return of the Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1974), both written by Francis Veber, who then cast him in the main role in his directorial
        debut, The Toy (1976). Their partnership achieved further success in three successful comedies of the early 1980s, La Chèvre (1981), Les Compères
        (1983) and Les Fugitifs (1986), which paired Richard with Gérard Depardieu. Richard returned behind the camera to direct On peut toujours rêver (1991)
        and Droit dans le mur (1997).</p>

        Pierre Richard

    <p class="text">
        Certainly one of France's supreme farceurs in the classic tradition, comedian Pierre Richard was born to an upper crust family with an embarrassing riches of
        middle names as he was christened Pierre Richard Maurice Charles Leopold Defays. Working and building up his trade at the Paris Music Hall in the early years,
        he appeared in small movie roles throughout most of the 60s. In the 70s, however, he aimed his genius directly towards film and succeeded beyond the wildest
        expectations. Directing and co-writing many of his slapstick vehicles, his characters often have  taken on an hilariously guileless persona and,
        coupled with his innate gift for klutzy physical comedy, have become an audience favorite for nearly four decades.
    </p>
    <p class="text">Has always claimed that he found his vocation while skipping school to attend Danny Kaye's vehicle "Up in arms" (1944) in theater. Years later,
        while in a Premiere of "Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire" (1972),         a lady came up to him and stated that he reminded her of her father.
        Only when she was out of reach did he learn she was actually Danny Kaye's daughter, Dena.</p>
  <p class="text">  Kept as a stage name, his Christian name was actually "Pierre Richard", chosen in reference to French matinée idol of the 1930s, Pierre Richard-Willm.
    Except for close relatives, every one he met after he became famous would assume "Richard" was his real surname.
